planEats, a platform for all your meal-planning needs

## Sub-Heading

planEats helps you plan meals and keep track of your hand-chosen or personally created recipes.

## Summary

This application not only offers a calendar to create new meal plans and update existing meal plans but can also connect to Google Calendar for automatic insertion of new events. PlanEats offers a database of over 350,000 recipes and the ability to create a recipe for insertion of personal recipes. Meals can be created on the ‘Meals’ page by selecting the wanted recipes and naming the meal, which will be inserted on the calendar at the desired time for future plans. The ‘Shop’ page also automatically populates a grocery shopping list with the ingredients for recipes to be cooked in the selected time period. The ‘Cook’ page will then display the accompanying instructions for each recipe in a meal, which allows for easy access when it’s finally time to prepare that meal. And, of course, if there simply isn’t time to search, a bevy of takeout options can be found by entering an address or zip code on the ‘Delivery’ page. Instructions for the entire process are available on the ‘About Us’ page.

## Our objective

planEats answers that age old question of “what’s for dinner?” With planEats, preparing a meal for yourself or your family is no longer a last-minute ordeal and keeping up with dozens of recipes is as simple as the click of a button.
